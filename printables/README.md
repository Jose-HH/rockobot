# Printables and Mechanics
This section will focus on the printables and mechanics side of Rockobot

## Detailed Components
- Motors
- 3D printing filament, including:
    - PLA+
    - PETG
    - TPU
- Screws
- Threaded Inserts?
- Nuts?

## Detailed Tools
- Screwdrivers
- 3D printers:
    - Ender 3 V2
    - Elegoo Neptune 2

## Detailed Requirements
- Get as close as possible to the 4 kg limit
- Make it near as big as the limit (350x350 mm)
- Low center of gravity, high stability
- Good traction, no slippery wheels
- High Torque, speed is not that important
- High resistance parts, intelligently print parts as durable as possible (high temps, low speeds, better materials, intelligent designs)

## 3D designs
Info about designs, pictures, why it was desgined that way

## Enhancing 3D prints strength
Info about how was each part printed, which temps, fan speeds, overall speeds, walls used, infill or any other tricks used for strengthening

## Mechanical designs
Info about how motors where connected to the battlebot, how torque was improved...

## Ideas
- 3D print the wok
- Think about an easy way of adding weigh to the robot. This is in order to get as close as possible to the 4kg limit, without surpassing it before final design.
