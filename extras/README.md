# Extras
This section is for adding not too important content to this repository, but could be sometimes useful. Here we have:
- One .docx and one PDF in how to build Rockobot-Shield, in Spanish (because it was made at a factory in Spain, where we live)
- Slides explaining briefly how was Rockobot made, main problems encountered and some history. Written in Spanish, no translation available
- Videos about the robot that were used in the slides
- PDF with tournament results. We achieved 5 victories and 1 tie
- This brief video about the 3D design of the robot: [https://youtu.be/NLl20Zu0xFw](https://youtu.be/NLl20Zu0xFw)
- Some images of Rockobot
