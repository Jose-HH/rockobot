# Rockobot
Battlebot made for SMP subject in Computer Science, UGR. This repository contains information about the mechanics, electronics and programming of the robot
along with parts lists, tools used, requirements to fulfill, ideas and a knowledge database. This README serves as an index for each subsection (Mechanics, Electronics and Programming) and for some generic stuff. For detailed information, see the READMEs for each subsection:

- [Mechanics/3D Printables](https://github.com/Pelochus/rockobot/tree/main/printables/)
- [Electronics](https://github.com/Pelochus/rockobot/tree/main/electronics/)
- [Arduino/Software](https://github.com/Pelochus/rockobot/tree/main/arduino/)

## Generic Requirements
- Put generic / basic requirements here
- Decent repairability (use screws, connectors instead of soldering)
- Make the robot as visually appealing as possible, this includes:
  - Cool shape
  - Some lighting
  - Reduce how many cables/screws are easy to see at a glance. This can be compensated by making them look cool/symmetrical

## TODO
- Official Robot name
- Reorganize each parts lists with a table, including units. Do on detailed READMEs
