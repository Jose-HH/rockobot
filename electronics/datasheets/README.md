# Datasheets
This subsections is of minor importance. Below some notes about the datasheets of the electronic components used

## Notes
- RCWL-1601 ultrasonic sensor is extremely similar to HC-SR04 counterpart but better. Almost everything is equal (even software) except for lower consumption (2 mA vs 8 mA) and this sensor is capable of 3.3V logic, making it a better choice for RPi and ESP32
- There is no specific datasheet for the 12V@100 RPM edition of the JGA25-370, so a partially complete datasheet + some PNGs from the store it was bought are included
- The step-down converter does not even have a specific part number. Similarly, some screenshots are included with information
- The red metallic button is also generic, so again some screenshots with some specs
