## Tools
- Soldering Iron
- Balance Charger

## Requirements
- Decent layout
- PCB/Perfboard
- Common Ground
- Ability to connect a disconnect components, very useful for replacing and repairing

## PCB
Information, design and photo of the PCB used

## Circuits
Schematics of independent circuits that deserve a subsection and a schematic of the whole circuit

## Ideas
- Use perfboards for semi-final prototypes
- Avoid as much as possible soldering for final version, use connectors whenever possible, improves repairability
- Include more than one infrarred sensor, for increased awareness of getting out of the designed battle area
