# Electronics 
This section will focus on the electronics side of Rockobot

## Components
- Arduino

## Tools
- Soldering Iron

## Requirements
- Decent layout
- PCB/Perfboard
- Common Ground

## PCB
Information, design and photo of the PCB used

## Circuits
Schematics of independent circuits that deserve a subsection and a schematic of the whole circuit

## Ideas
- Use perfboards for semi-final prototypes
- Avoid as much as possible soldering for final version, use connectors whenever possible, improves repairability

## Knowledge Base
[Important Knowledge](put link in here)
